Zones setting [#JF-blog]_
=========================
Heart Rate Zone
---------------
#. Lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR)

   Run a 30mn time trial alone.

   LTHR is average HR during last 20mn.

#. Compute HR zones as

  - Running

    * Zone 1 > 85% of LTHR
    * Zone 2 85% to 89% of LTHR
    * Zone 3 90% to 94% of LTHR
    * Zone 4 95% to 99% of LTHR
    * Zone 5a 100% to 102% of LTHR
    * Zone 5b 103% to 106% of LTHR
    * Zone 5c < 106% of LTHR

  - Cycling

    * Zone 1 > 81% of LTHR
    * Zone 2 81% to 89% of LTHR
    * Zone 3 90% to 93% of LTHR
    * Zone 4 94% to 99% of LTHR
    * Zone 5a 100% to 102% of LTHR
    * Zone 5b 103% to 106% of LTHR
    * Zone 5c < 106% of LTHR

Pace Zones (Running)
--------------------
#. Functional Threshold Pace (FTPa)

   Run a 30mn time trial alone.

   FTPa is average pace

#. Compute your pace zones as

  * Zone 1 < 129% of FTPa
  * Zone 2 114% to 129% of FTPa
  * Zone 3 106% to 113% of FTPa
  * Zone 4 99% to 105% of FTPa
  * Zone 5a 97% to 100% of FTPa
  * Zone 5b 90% to 96% of FTPa
  * Zone 5c > 90% of FTPa


Power zone (Cycling)
--------------------
#. Functional Threshold Power (FTPw).

   Do a 30mn time trial (flat course, no traffic light).

   Average power is FTPw

#. Establish training zones as

  * Zone 1 < 55% of FTPw
  * Zone 2 55% to 74% of FTPw
  * Zone 3 75% to 89% of FTPw
  * Zone 4 90% to 104% of FTPw
  * Zone 5 105% to 120% of FTPw
  * Zone 6 > 120% of FTPw

Swimming Pace (T-time)
----------------------
Swim a 1000-meter/yard time trial

T-time is time divided by 10

Workout refers to T-time +/- n seconds.
