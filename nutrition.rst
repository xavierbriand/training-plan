Nutrition
=========
General
-------
- Avoid processed food (poor in nutrients) [#TP-top10]_.
- Vary food [#TP-top10]_
- Good breakfast (20-25% daily calories intake, ~15g of protein) within 1 hour
  of waking [#TP-top10]_
- Protein should come from good quality products (organic, free range, ...),
  be lean (chicken breast, fish, eggs, beans, lentils). [#TP-top10]_
- Carbs should be mainly from vegies and fruits (more nutrients) [#KB-TN]_
- Have an acid/alkaline balanced died (see PRAL.rst) [#JF-TB]_

Recommended intake per day
--------------------------
- Vegetables and Fruit: 8-10 [#TP-top10]_
- Grain Products: 8
- Milk and Alternatives: 2
- Meat and Alternatives: 3
- Water 2,5L-3L (Urine must be clear/pale) [#TP-top10]_

- 2g of protein per kg per day for a man [#KB-TN]_
- 6-8g of carbs per kg per day (sprint/olympic)
- 8-10 of carbs per kg per day (ironman)

- To balance blood sugar during the day: [#KB-TN]_

  - 3 meals/day (1/3 protein, 1/3 fat, 1/3 carbs)
  - 3 snacks/day (1/2 protein or fat + 1/2 carbs)
  - 3 hours between meals and snacks

Repartition of calories between nutrients
-----------------------------------------
- Carbs: 40-60% [#TP-top10]_
- Fiber: 30-50g [#TP-top10]_
- Protein: 10-35%
- Fat: 20-35%

  - Monounsaturated: 1/2 [#KB-TN]_
  - Polyunsaturated: 1/4 [#KB-TN]_
  - Polysaturated: > 1/4 [#KB-TN]_
- Maximize Omega-3 (cold water fish, chia seeds, ground flax seed, flax seed oil) [#TP-top10]_
- Reduce saturated fat [#TP-top10]_
- Eliminate hydrogenated/modified/fractionated/trans fat [#TP-top10]_

Grams of nutrients to calories
------------------------------
1g of carbs   = 4 calories
1g of protein = 4 calories
1g of protein = 9 calories

EER (Estimated Energy Requirement)
---------------------------------------
Total Energy Expenditure, in kcal/day, for an adults 19 years and older [#HC-DRI]_

``EER = 662 - (9.53 x age [y]) + PA x {(15.91 x weight [kg]) + (539.6 x height [m]) }``

Workout
-------
3R (Rehydrate, refuel, repair) [#TP-top10]_

Pre-exercise
""""""""""""
- 0.5-1L of water 2-3 hours before [#TP-top10]_
- Up to 1-1.5g of carbs per body weight (kg) 2 hours before [#TP-top10]_ [#JF-TB]_

During exercise
"""""""""""""""
- Water: 125-250mL per 15-20mn / 400-800mL/h [#TP-top10]_ [#JF-TB]_

If lasting more than 90mn:

- Carbs (every 15mn)

  From high glycemic index, liquids form. [#JF-TB]_

  - <3h: 30-60g/h [#TP-top10]_
  - >3h: 60-90g/h [#TP-top10]_
- Electrolyte (sea salt): 250-500mg/h [#TP-top10]_

Post exercise
"""""""""""""
- Water: 1L/kg lost (+1g/L sea salt) or until urine is clear/pale [#TP-top10]_

With 15-20mn:

- Carbs: ~1g/kg of body weight (high glycemic Index) [#TP-top10]_ [#JF-TB]_

  High glycemic index carbs not recommended without protein (may reduce release
  of growth hormone) [#JF-TB]_
- 15-20g of protein [#JF-TB]_
- Fat, Fibre: low [#TP-top10]_

Within 2h:

Have a meal:

- Carbs: 1-1.5g/kg of body weight [#TP-top10]_

  Favorite starches. Best is potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, bananas and raisins
  (high in alkaline) [#JF-TB]_
- Protein: 10-15g [#TP-top10]_
- Vitamin C, iron [#TP-top10]_
